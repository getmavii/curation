## Prompt

I am creating a spreadsheet that ranks the quality and reliability of **Investing** websites. They can be be upranked or downranked by changing the boost value.

It should cover topics like:

- Stock Market
- Real Estate
- Bonds
- Cryptocurrency
- Mutual Funds
- Retirement Planning

The spreedsheet has the following columns:

Site: The domain of the site without the path. Lowercase.
Path: The path to relevant content on the site.
Boost: A value between -10 and 10 that changes the rank of a matching result.
Discard: Remove this site/path from the results. Should be TRUE or FALSE.
Reasoning: Why this site was chosen. Enclose in quotes to escape commas.

Please make a comprehensive list of the most popular sites with appropriate boosts as a CSV. Discard sites that contain misinformation. Explain why you chose each site. Don't include any other examples in the generated CSV.

```
Site,Path,Boost,Discard,Reasoning
example.com,/,5,FALSE,"Established site..."
badsiteexample.com,/,-10,TRUE,"Misinformation..."
```

## Response

Creating a comprehensive list of investing websites based on their quality and reliability is subjective, and the boosts I suggest are based on the perceived reputation and general reception of the sites as of my last training data in September 2021. Note that this is a generalized assessment, and real-time reviews, feedback, or specific analysis might provide deeper insights.

Here's a CSV list for your criteria:

```
Site,Path,Boost,Discard,Reasoning
seekingalpha.com,/,7,FALSE,"Reputable source for stock market analysis and insights."
investopedia.com,/,9,FALSE,"Educational resource for investing topics and financial concepts."
morningstar.com,/,8,FALSE,"Trusted source for mutual funds, stocks, and ETF ratings."
zillow.com,/,6,FALSE,"Popular site for real estate prices, trends, and market analysis."
realtor.com,/,6,FALSE,"Reliable source for real estate listings and market information."
bloomberg.com,/,8,FALSE,"Renowned for financial news, stock market data, and economic insights."
coinmarketcap.com,/cryptocurrency,8,FALSE,"Leading source for cryptocurrency prices and market caps."
coinbase.com,/learn,6,FALSE,"Educational content related to cryptocurrency."
bonds.com,/,-10,TRUE,"Domain redirect as of last training data. Not specifically for bond information."
vanguard.com,/,8,FALSE,"Major investment management company known for mutual funds and retirement services."
fidelity.com,/,8,FALSE,"Prominent financial services firm with resources on stocks, mutual funds, and retirement."
bitcoin.org,/en/how-it-works,6,FALSE,"Information about Bitcoin, one of the leading cryptocurrencies."
fool.com,/,7,FALSE,"Financial and investing advice, known for its Stock Advisor service."
yahoo.com,/finance,7,FALSE,"Provides news and data about stocks, mutual funds, and other investment topics."
nasdaq.com,/,7,FALSE,"Official site for NASDAQ stock market, provides stock quotes and market analysis."
```

Note:

1. This list is not exhaustive and is based on a general understanding as of 2021.
2. The `Boost` values are subjective and represent a general idea of each site's reputation and reliability.
3. It's essential to always conduct independent research and due diligence when using any site for financial decisions.
4. Real-time data or newer sites emerging after 2021 would not be included in this list.
