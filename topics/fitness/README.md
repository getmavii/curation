## Prompt

I am creating a spreadsheet that ranks the quality and reliability of **Fitness** websites. They can be be upranked or downranked by changing the boost value.

It should cover topics like:

- Cardio
- Weight Training
- Yoga & Pilates
- Nutrition
- Supplements
- Mental Wellbeing

The spreedsheet has the following columns:

Site: The domain of the site. Lowercase.
Path: The path of a specific section of the site. This is optional. Only include this if it's critical.
Boost: A value between -10 and 10 that changes the rank of a matching result.
Discard: Remove this site/path from the results. Should be TRUE or FALSE.

Please make a comprehensive list of the most popular sites with appropriate boosts using the CSV format. Discard sites that contain misinformation. Explain why you chose each site.

```
Site,Path,Boost,Discard
example.com,,5,FALSE
```
