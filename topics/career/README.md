## Prompt

I am creating a spreadsheet that ranks the quality and reliability of **Career** websites. They can be be upranked or downranked by changing the boost value.

It should cover the following subtopics:

- Resume Writing
- Interview Tips
- Career Advancement
- Career Transition
- Freelancing
- Networking
- Remote Work

The spreedsheet has the following columns:

Site: The domain of the site. Lowercase.
Path: The path of a specific section of the site. This is optional. Only include this if it's critical.
Boost: A value between -10 and 10 that changes the rank of a matching result.
Discard: Remove this site/path from the results. Should be TRUE or FALSE.

Please make a comprehensive list of the most popular sites with appropriate boosts using the CSV format. Discard sites that contain misinformation. Explain why you chose each site.

```
Site,Path,Boost,Discard
example.com,,5,FALSE
```

## Response

Creating a comprehensive list involves subjective judgment based on the reputation of each website as of my last update in September 2021. The numbers provided in the "Boost" column are indicative and may not reflect the most current status of the website. It's essential for you to validate this list and adapt it according to the most recent information.

Here's a sample CSV based on known quality and reliability:

```
Site,Path,Boost,Discard
linkedin.com,/learning/topics/career-development,7,FALSE
glassdoor.com,/interview/index.htm,6,FALSE
monster.com,/career-advice/,6,FALSE
thebalancecareers.com,,10,FALSE
resume.com,/advice,4,FALSE
topresume.com,/blog,4,FALSE
forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil,,5,FALSE
indeed.com,/career-advice,7,FALSE
remote.co,,5,FALSE
upwork.com,/blog,3,FALSE
flexjobs.com,/blog,5,FALSE
careerbuilder.com,,4,FALSE
vault.com,,4,FALSE
roberthalf.com,/blog,5,FALSE
penelopetrunk.com,,3,FALSE
freelancersunion.org,,4,FALSE
meetup.com,,2,FALSE
```

2. `glassdoor.com`: Popular for company reviews and interview experiences.
