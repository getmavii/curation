## Prompt

I am creating a spreadsheet that ranks the quality and reliability of **book** websites. They can be be upranked or downranked by changing the boost value.

It should cover the following categories:

- Fiction
- Non-fiction
- Classics
- Young Adult
- Self-help
- Biographies
- Graphic Novels

The spreedsheet has the following columns:

Site: The domain of the site. Lowercase.
Path: The path of a specific section of the site. This is optional. Only include this if it's critical.
Boost: A value between -10 and 10 that changes the rank of a matching result.
Discard: Remove this site/path from the results. Should be TRUE or FALSE.

Please make a comprehensive list of the most popular sites with appropriate boosts using the CSV format. Discard sites that contain misinformation. Explain why you chose each site.

```
Site,Path,Boost,Discard
example.com,,5,FALSE
```

## Response

Certainly! Here is a list of popular book websites across the categories you mentioned. Please note that these websites were chosen based on their popularity, reputation, and reliability as of my last update in 2021. Any new websites or changes to the reliability of these websites after this time are not reflected in this list.

Explanation for some sites:

- **goodreads.com**: A platform for book lovers to rate, review, and discuss books. It covers all categories and has the largest database of books. Hence the high boost.

Discarding sites:

- As of my last update, none of the sites mentioned are known to contain misinformation, so the `Discard` column is set to `FALSE` for all.

Remember to adjust the Boost values as per your preference or any new data you might have.
