## Prompt

I am creating a spreadsheet that ranks the quality and reliability of **Books** websites. They can be be upranked or downranked by changing the boost value.

It should cover topics like:

- Fiction
- Non-fiction
- Classics
- Young Adult
- Self-help
- Biographies
- Graphic Novels

The spreedsheet has the following columns:

Site: The domain of the site without the path. Lowercase.
Path: The path to relevant content on the site.
Boost: A value between -10 and 10 that changes the rank of a matching result.
Discard: Remove this site/path from the results. Should be TRUE or FALSE.
Reasoning: Why this site was chosen. Enclose in quotes to escape commas.

Please make a comprehensive list of the most popular sites with appropriate boosts as a CSV. Discard sites that contain misinformation. Explain why you chose each site. Don't include any other examples in the generated CSV.

```

example.com,/,5,FALSE,"Established site..."

## Response

Certainly! Here's a comprehensive list of some well-known and reputable book-related websites, including their specific paths (if applicable), boost values, discard criteria, and reasoning:

```

Please note that the above list is not exhaustive, and boost values are somewhat arbitrary based on my understanding of the relative influence, reliability, and relevance of the given websites. Boost values can be adjusted based on specific criteria or further research into user engagement and trust for each site.
