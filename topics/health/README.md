## Prompt

I am creating a spreadsheet that ranks the quality and reliability of **Health** websites. They can be be upranked or downranked by changing the boost value.

It should cover topics like:

- Mental Health
- Nutrition
- Diseases & Conditions
- Medication & Supplements
- Alternative Medicine
- Fitness & Exercise

The spreedsheet has the following columns:

Site: The domain of the site without the path. Lowercase.
Path: The path to relevant content on the site.
Boost: A value between -10 and 10 that changes the rank of a matching result.
Discard: Remove this site/path from the results. Should be TRUE or FALSE.
Reasoning: Why this site was chosen. Enclose in quotes to escape commas.

Please make a comprehensive list of the most popular sites with appropriate boosts as a CSV. Discard sites that contain misinformation. Explain why you chose each site. Don't include any other examples in the generated CSV.

```
Site,Path,Boost,Discard,Reasoning
example.com,/,5,FALSE,"Established site..."
badsiteexample.com,/,-10,TRUE,"Misinformation..."
```

## Response

The following is a fictitious representation of a list based on the criteria provided. However, this list might not be comprehensive, and the boosts provided are approximate based on general perceptions as of the last update in 2021. For a genuine analysis, it's imperative to conduct thorough research, including checking current reputations and the accuracy of the content of each site.

```
Site,Path,Boost,Discard,Reasoning
mayoclinic.org,/,9,FALSE,"Esteemed medical institution with accurate and comprehensive health information."
webmd.com,/,7,FALSE,"Popular health website providing a wide range of health information. Known for credibility but occasionally critiqued for being overly commercial."
nih.gov,/,10,FALSE,"Official website of the National Institutes of Health. Offers authoritative health information and recent research findings."
medlineplus.gov,/,10,FALSE,"Service by the National Library of Medicine. Provides high-quality, up-to-date health information."
psychcentral.com,/,8,FALSE,"Reliable source for mental health information. Contains articles, news, and resources for mental health topics."
nutrition.org,/,7,FALSE,"Reputable source for nutrition information, supported by the American Society for Nutrition."
clevelandclinic.org,/,9,FALSE,"Prominent hospital and health system. Provides comprehensive information on diseases, conditions, treatments, and more."
rxlist.com,/medications,8,FALSE,"Well-known for providing detailed information about medications, including side effects, interactions, and more."
examine.com,/supplements,8,FALSE,"Focuses on providing evidence-based information about supplements and nutrition. Known for referencing scientific studies."
drweil.com,/,6,FALSE,"Popular site on integrative medicine. Provides information on alternative medicine, nutrition, and general health."
acefitness.org,/,7,FALSE,"Reputable organization in the fitness industry. Provides resources on fitness, exercise, and personal training."
mercola.com,/,0,TRUE,"Has been critiqued for spreading health misinformation and making unsupported claims. Controversial."
naturalnews.com,/,0,TRUE,"Known for promoting conspiracy theories and pseudoscientific health claims. Highly controversial."
```

Again, note that the values, especially in the `Boost` column, are approximations and based on general perceptions up to the last update in 2021. Ensure thorough research and due diligence for real-world applications.
