I am creating a spreadsheet that ranks the quality and reliability of **Fitness** websites. They can be be upranked or downranked by changing the boost value.

It should cover topics like:

- Cardio
- Weight Training
- Yoga & Pilates
- Nutrition
- Supplements
- Mental Wellbeing

The spreedsheet has the following columns:

Site: The domain of the site without the path. Lowercase.
Path: The path to relevant content on the site.
Boost: A value between -10 and 10 that changes the rank of a matching result.
Discard: Remove this site/path from the results. Should be TRUE or FALSE.
Reasoning: Why this site was chosen. Enclose in quotes to escape commas.

Please make a comprehensive list of the most popular sites with appropriate boosts as a CSV. Discard sites that contain misinformation. Explain why you chose each site. Don't include any other examples in the generated CSV.

```
Site,Path,Boost,Discard,Reasoning
example.com,/,5,FALSE,"Established site..."
badsiteexample.com,/,-10,TRUE,"Misinformation..."
```
